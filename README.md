# Assignment #2

This program allows users to search for a TV show, gives them a list, and saves the details of the one they select to a `shows` sheet in the Excel file. Your assignment is to add to this program so that it also saves all the episodes for the selected show to a sheet called `episodes`. **Make sure that the episodes have some way of showing which show they are for.**


## What to Do

1. Download the code from [this link](https://github.com/Mottelz/tvmaze-excel/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).
2. In the terminal, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`. This should install the missing packages. If it doesn't work, you can just open the files and tell PyCharm to install the packages.
3. Add to the code so that it also gets and saves the episodes for each show to a separate sheet called `episodes`. **Make sure that the episodes have some way of showing which show they are for.**
4. Save your code into a ZIP file.
5. Upload your submission to Omnivox.
